Design philosophies of Squash:

- Project management is about five fundimental ideas: 
    Projects, Tickets, Stories, Workflow, and Reporting.
- Most models in the project management world are the same:
    they just have different naming conventions, so Squash must allow admins 
    to change these names.
- Project management fails if users do not use the program, 
    so Squash must be easy and fun to use, while retaining accesibility.
- Administrating project management software is very difficult when you can't
    get to the data, so Squash must be easy to interface with.
