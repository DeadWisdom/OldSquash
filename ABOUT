Squash is a distributed, configurable issue tracking system, with both web and
console front ends.  It can be configured to be a bug-tracker, a general 
issue-tracker, or an Agile methodology management tool.

Squash follows the philosophy that your project management tool should be 
easy to use and accessible, so that project management happens naturally,
organically, and with minimum start up cost.
